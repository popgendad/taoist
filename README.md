This project is still under development and is not yet ready for release. It is a simple utility that relies on the [official Todoist Python REST API](https://github.com/Doist/todoist-api-python). This software is not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Doist. The `taoist` utility has functionality for performing basic transactions involving Todoist projects, sections, labels and tasks. The goal of the project is to enable most major components of 
a ["getting-things-done"](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done) workflow from a terminal environment and is not intended to replicate the functionality of the Todoist app.

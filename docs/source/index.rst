Taoist: Python-based Terminal Utility for Todoist
=================================================
 
``Taoist`` is a simple command line utility that relies on the 
`official Todoist Python REST API <https://github.com/Doist/todoist-api-python>`_.
This software is not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Doist. 
The ``taoist`` utility has functionality for performing basic transactions involving
Todoist projects, sections, labels and tasks. The goal of the project is to enable most
major components of a `getting-things-done <https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done>`_
workflow from a terminal environment and is not intended to replicate the functionality of the Todoist app.

Check out the :doc:`quickstart` section for further information, including :ref:`installation` 
and :ref:`examples`.
